## It contains different hands-on data science projects done by me by using raw codes (Without using Scikit Learn except for SVM). 

#### Covid-19 critical cases - Used Logistic Regression with preprocessing. Got an weighted F1 Score of 79.2% on test set.

#### Namami Ganga - Used SVM with preprocessing. Got an accuracy of 73% on test set.

#### Passport Checking - Used Decison Trees and got an accuracy of 97% on test set.

#### Suspicious Vehicles - Used Random Forests and got an accuracy of 88.5% on test set.

#### e-commerce startup - Used Linear Regression and got an MSE of 268.5 on test set.

#### e-commerce website - Used Decision Trees with preprocessing. Datasets are in ARFF format. Link of dataset is present in README file inside the folder. Got an accuracy of 73% on test set.

#### online coaching platform - Used K-NN with preprocessing. Got an accuracy of 96.1% on test set.

#### spam emails - Used Naive Bayes classifier with preprocessing of emails. Got an accuracy of 98% on test set.

#### student placements - Used regression with preprocessing. Got an MSE of 31.9 on test set.
